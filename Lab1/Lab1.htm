		<h3> About me <h3>
<pre>

I am very passionate about technology and being able to help people
(especially older and under privileged people)learn about 
technology and how it can improve their day today lives. My favorite
sport is football, my favorite video game is pokemon, my favorite
food is pizza, & my favorite tv show is Breaking Bad (see gif).

I do have some database experience, we used an Access database
to keep track of our server licenses and I work with oracle 
databases at my current job with the university. I am also in IT 378.

I have a limited amount of experience using web development 
technologies. I took a basic web development class in high
school and have coded a few very basic websites.

Question 1 <br>
Using mashups in web development is becoming a very common practice. A mashup is combining various aspects from different websites into one functional website. A common example of this is Illinois State University using google maps API to show their campus map on their website. There are many different genres of mashups including Maps, Photos and Videos, search and shopping, and finally news mashups. These mashups take information from sites such as google, twitter, and amazon and display them in a fashion which is relevant to their website, thus improving its content vastly. 

There are many different types of technologies that go into creating a mashup. One of the most important technologies used is the Application Programming Interface (API0). An API gives source code for the websites that are aggregated into the mashup, such as a twitter API that shows how to display a certain individuals tweets on their website. These requests are typically done through the server of the original website, thus making the logic hosted on the mashup but not necessarily executed there. There are several challenges that come with creating a mashup, such as maintaining multi-functional servers and databases, keeping up with new trends in original website API, and most importantly legal concerns pertaining to using the original content.

Question 2<br>
Showing up at the top of the google search result is a dream of many web designers. Typically your website showing up at the top of a google search is the epitome, you made, in the instance of the search your website is second to none, but do the best websites really show up at the top of a google search. This article discussed the activates of JC Penny and how they manipulated their way to the top of almost every apparel based google search, using so called “black-hat” tactics. 
JC Penny alleged that “someone” created over 2000 websites that link directly to their homepage, this exploits a feature in Googles search result algorithm that moves websites with more links higher up in the search result. Links to JC Penny’s website were found on banking, casino, and even nuclear engineering websites. BMW tried this action and it received a ban from google meaning that it does not show up on google searches. Jc Penny has had it search results returned to normal since the incident.
