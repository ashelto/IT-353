		<h3> About me <h3>
<pre>

I am very passionate about technology and being able to help people
(especially older and under privileged people)learn about 
technology and how it can improve their day today lives. My favorite
sport is football, my favorite video game is pokemon, my favorite
food is pizza, & my favorite tv show is Breaking Bad (see gif).

Breaking Bad &gt Dexter

I do have some database experience, we used an Access database
to keep track of our server licenses and I work with oracle 
databases at my current job with the university. I am also in IT 378.

I have a limited amount of experience using web development 
technologies. I took a basic web development class in high
school and have coded a few very basic websites.

				<h2>Questions </h2>
<pre>	
What I found most interesting about the second article that was not present in the first was the expansion on the aspect of cookies. 
I feel that most people have a general understand of what cookies ae but dont have a working knowledge of what they are. I was very 
interested how the browser actually saves the cookies to the computer for further use. I also found the extensive discussion of AJAX 
to be very interesting. I have always been very interested in how AJAx works with websites and constant asynchronous communication with 
the server is extremely useful than an one load website. The last item that I found very interesting in the article that was not
presented in the first article was the different types of DNS discussed. I wasnt aware of the different types of DNS and that was very 
insightful into how that device is provided on many different levels. 

MEAN is an open source Javascript Software stack. The first question I asked after reading that was what exactly is a software stack?
 After doing some research about software stacks or software solutions I found out that they are pieces of software that work in 
 conjunction with a web application. In the case of Web Development they are the programming tools, databases, and web severs among 
 others. MEAN is particularly useful because it is able to combine multiple frameworks allowing programmers to work in them all at 
 once. Thus allowing them to create highly dynamic and intuitive websites. 

A framework, specifically a web application framework, is a abstract (or knowledge base, solutions) that supports the development 
of web applications. There frameworks make development far easier through the use of additional services such as an API, security 
features, and networking features. Some examples of Web Application Frameworks are AJAX, MVC, and API. Frameworks make programming 
far easier and provide environmental features, and services that are very important to designing and developing various software 
and web applications.  Search Engine Optimization is the process of manipulating a website to increase its presence on search
engines, thus making it more popular. Websites use Search Engine Optimization to improve their chances of getting noticed when 
services related to theirs are searched (or googled). There is a fine line between what is and what is not legal when it comes 
to search engine optimization and many companies have been banned from google for exploiting their algorithms to show up higher 
on web searches.
