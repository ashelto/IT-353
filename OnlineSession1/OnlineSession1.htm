3. When the shopping cart, which is essentially an Item array with cost and capacity instance variables, reaches 3(which is the initial capacity or size) it runs 
the increaseSize() method. What the increase size method does is creates a new item array called tempItem, with the same capacity as the original shopping cart, 
then doubles the size (via the capacity instance variable) and copies all of the items from tempItem into the new shopping cart that is now half full (due to the 
double in size).

4. Basically what the program is doing is once the shopping cart is full, the program creates a temporary shopping cart, moves all of the items from the original 
shopping cart to the temporary cart, doubles the size of the original shopping cart, then returns the items from the temporary shopping cart back to the original 
shopping cart. 

6. In this example the cart object is never created outside of the constructor, thus the cart would not be able to be identified, and eventually added to and 
increased in size, thus creating a null pointer exception. 

8. Many changes would have to be made to the Item class, first the abstract method would have to be created wit the logic(see below). Second, if you actually
wanted to display the discounted price you would also have to change to toString method to show the discount(maybe?) and the new price. 

Logic for the discount() abstract method. (note: this returns the final price after incorporating the discount)
@Override
        public double discount(double price, int quantity) 
        {
            price = getPrice();
            quantity = getQuantity();
            double totalPrice = price * quantity;
            double discountPrice = totalPrice - (totalPrice *.10);
            NumberFormat fmt = NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance();
            fmt.format(discountPrice);
            return discountPrice;
        }
		
9. No, you would need to factor in the discount before you added the price of that particular item the the total price. 

10. This code would print out three dots if the total amount of the discount was greater than 20 cents.
